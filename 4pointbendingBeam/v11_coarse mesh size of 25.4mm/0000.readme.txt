This is 4 point bending beam analysis using Abaqus.
Concrete Damaged Plasticity CDP model was used for beam
Elasto-plastic model was used for rebar
Elastic model was used for steel supports
simulation time = 1 seconds
simulation data print step = 0.05 seconds / 20 steps
Solver used = Dynamic Implicit
